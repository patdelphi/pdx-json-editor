# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the custom search panel functionality with Monaco Editor's native search capabilities. Instead of maintaining a separate search UI, we will integrate with Monaco's built-in search widget which provides a more consistent and feature-rich search experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Monaco's native search functionality so that I have access to all the built-in search features and shortcuts that I'm familiar with from VS Code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) THEN the system SHALL trigger Monaco's native search widget
2. WHEN the user clicks a search button/icon THEN the system SHALL open Monaco's native search widget
3. WHEN Monaco's search widget is open THEN the system SHALL NOT display the custom search panel
4. WHEN the user uses Monaco's search widget THEN the system SHALL provide the same search functionality as the native VS Code experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access replace functionality through Monaco's native interface so that I can use familiar keyboard shortcuts and UI patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+H (or Cmd+H on Mac) THEN the system SHALL trigger Monaco's native find and replace widget
2. WHEN the user opens the replace functionality THEN the system SHALL use Monaco's built-in replace interface
3. WHEN performing replacements THEN the system SHALL use Monaco's native replacement logic and validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the custom search panel code so that the codebase is simpler and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Monaco native search THEN the system SHALL remove the custom SearchPanel component
2. WHEN removing custom search THEN the system SHALL remove all related search service functions that duplicate Monaco functionality
3. WHEN cleaning up code THEN the system SHALL remove search-related state management from parent components
4. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain any search-related accessibility features through Monaco's built-in accessibility support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retain search history and preferences so that my search experience remains personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Monaco search THEN the system SHALL leverage Monaco's built-in search history
2. WHEN configuring search options THEN the system SHALL use Monaco's native options (case sensitive, whole word, regex)
3. WHEN the editor loads THEN the system SHALL configure Monaco to remember search preferences across sessions if possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts to work consistently so that I can use familiar shortcuts for search operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+F THEN the system SHALL open Monaco's find widget
2. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+H THEN the system SHALL open Monaco's find and replace widget
3. WHEN the user presses Escape in search mode THEN the system SHALL close Monaco's search widget
4. WHEN the user presses F3 or Enter THEN the system SHALL find the next match using Monaco's logic
5. WHEN the user presses Shift+F3 or Shift+Enter THEN the system SHALL find the previous match using Monaco's logic
