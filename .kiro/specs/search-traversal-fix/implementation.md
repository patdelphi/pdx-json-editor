# Search Traversal Fix Implementation

After analyzing the code, I've identified the issue with the search traversal functionality. The problem is that the state updates in React are asynchronous, and the Monaco editor's decorations and selections are not being properly updated when navigating through search results.

## Root Cause

1. The `currentResultIndex` state update is asynchronous, so when we try to use it immediately after setting it, we're still using the old value.
2. The decorations are not being properly updated because of this asynchronous behavior.
3. There might be conflicts between our custom search implementation and Monaco's built-in search functionality.

## Solution

I'll implement a completely different approach to fix the search traversal functionality:

1. Create a direct reference to the current result index using a ref to avoid the asynchronous state update issue.
2. Simplify the search navigation functions to focus on the core functionality.
3. Ensure that the decorations are properly updated when navigating through search results.
4. Add more robust error handling and logging to help diagnose any issues.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add a ref to track the current result index
2. Modify the search navigation functions to use this ref
3. Simplify the decoration update logic
4. Add more robust error handling and logging
