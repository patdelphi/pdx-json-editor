# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The search traversal functionality in the JSON Editor application is currently not working properly. Users are unable to navigate through search results using the previous and next buttons. This feature is essential for users to efficiently navigate through search matches in large JSON files. This specification outlines the requirements for fixing this issue.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a JSON editor user, I want to be able to navigate through search results using the next and previous buttons, so that I can efficiently review all matches in my document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "next" button (↓) THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next search result in the document
2. WHEN the user clicks the "previous" button (↑) THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous search result in the document
3. WHEN the user reaches the last search result and clicks "next" THEN the system SHALL cycle back to the first result
4. WHEN the user is at the first search result and clicks "previous" THEN the system SHALL cycle to the last result
5. WHEN the user navigates to a new search result THEN the system SHALL highlight the current result with a distinct color
6. WHEN the user navigates to a new search result THEN the system SHALL scroll the editor to ensure the result is visible
7. WHEN the user navigates through results THEN the system SHALL update the result counter to show the current position (e.g., "Item 3 of 10 results")

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a JSON editor user, I want keyboard shortcuts for search result navigation to work properly, so that I can navigate through results without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Enter in the search panel THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next search result
2. WHEN the user presses Shift+Enter in the search panel THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous search result
3. WHEN the user uses keyboard shortcuts for navigation THEN the system SHALL behave consistently with the button navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a JSON editor user, I want visual feedback when navigating through search results, so that I can easily identify the current match.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search result is selected as current THEN the system SHALL apply a distinct highlight style to differentiate it from other matches
2. WHEN the user navigates to a different search result THEN the system SHALL update the highlight styles accordingly
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a counter indicating the current position and total number of matches
