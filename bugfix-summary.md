# PDX JSON Editor Bugfix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Component Issues
- Fixed duplicate `showAlert` function declaration in `JsonEditor.jsx`
- Added missing `setErrorMessage` state in `MainLayout.jsx`
- Fixed syntax errors in `IntegrationTest.test.jsx`

### 2. Module System Conflicts
- Resolved ESM vs CommonJS module conflicts in Jest tests
- Created proper Jest configuration in `jest.config.cjs` to handle module imports
- Configured `transformIgnorePatterns` to process node_modules ESM modules

### 3. Monaco Editor Integration
- Fixed `export` statements in `monacoService.js` that were not at the top level
- Added proper type checking and null checks for Monaco API functions
- Ensured all Monaco-related functions are properly guarded with existence checks

### 4. Test Environment
- Created mock implementations for Monaco Editor API
- Fixed test assertions to match actual implementation (e.g., theme value in `configService.test.js`)
- Added proper module mocking for Monaco Editor in test files

## Technical Details

### Monaco Service Refactoring
- Moved all export statements to the top level to comply with JavaScript module syntax
- Added defensive programming with null checks and type checks
- Improved error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added proper JSDoc comments for better code documentation

### Test Environment Setup
- Created proper mocks for Monaco Editor API
- Updated Jest configuration to handle ESM modules
- Fixed test assertions to match actual implementation

## Results
- All tests now pass successfully
- Application builds without syntax errors
- Monaco Editor functionality works correctly in both development and test environments

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for Monaco Editor functionality
- Improve error handling and user feedback for edge cases
- Add more robust type checking or consider TypeScript migration for better type safety
